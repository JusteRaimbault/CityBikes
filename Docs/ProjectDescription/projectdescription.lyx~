, at least 16 countries have adopted it, although majority of implemented
 systems are still in France (26 systems in France out of 78 in the world).

After the system is installed, some problems often appears through its use:
 depending on time of day and landuse (residential or work area), stations
 can be totally empty or full on a all district, what strongly decrease
 the quality of the service and does not encourage the users to go on using
 it.
 Field survey or eye overview on data can simply confirm that fact.
 Therefore, companies use trucks to redistribute the bikes and avoid such
 problems.
 That need a precise knowledge of flows or even hypothetical trajectories
 of bikes, what have been done on the Velo'v system in Lyon: construction
 of a fine statistical cyclic model in

Work proposal and expected results

\begin_layout Paragraph
Project description
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most of existing litterature on the subject seems to be centered on statistical
 analysis and prediction, i.
 e.
 top-down optimization methods from a complex systems point of view, as
 the statistical analysis presented before.
 Through these flow predictions, it is obvious to proceed to operationnal
 research optimisation, e.
 g.
 to a weighted Trade-Saleman-Problem algorithm for optimization of the trajector
y of the redistribution truck.
 However, the results of such mehods can be complicated or costly to implement.

\begin_layout Standard
We would like to investigate how could be useful bottom-up simple and cheap
 measures for a better repartition of bikes, or at least for a better experience
 of the user.
 Since such measures can only be taken at the local scale of stations or
 bike, or on isolated users, it appears to be necessary to create an agent-based
 model of simulation for movements of users and bikes, in which local measures
 can be integrated.
 For example, we could first try to evaluate the consequences of the free-time
 reward when a user let his bike on a high station (solution that has already
 been implemented, but that could need a better evaluation of the optimal
 reward time).
 Then local solution can be faster information screens on stations that
 give available bikes or parking places on other station around, or the
 effect of better general knowledge of the system by users.
\begin_inset VSpace bigskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since high bonus stations can be a minority of the system, we may concentrate
 more on the propensity of user to drop or take their bikes at a certain
 distance of their objective point (which will be of course a function of
 the distance and possibly of the type of user if we define heterogeneous
 users) and on the associated possible knowledge that the user can have
 of the current situation of the bike distribution.
 Given distribution of stations and spatial tendancies of flows, it is not
 obvious that increasing these parameters will directly impact the homogeneity
 of bikes repartition (a simple argument going that way can be the case
 were a user can't go over a certain walking distance, but all network is
 congestioned on a greater radius around his objective point; in that case
 increasing his knowledge will have no effect).
\begin_inset VSpace bigskip

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To sum up abstractly, our aim is to explore bottom-up measures through directly
 associated bottom-up means (the agent-based model).

\begin_layout Paragraph
Collect and treatment of data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The model will have to be usable on real situations, we have therefore to
 use GIS data of a real city, that will be arbitrary Paris.
 The collection of GIS data can be done through OpenStreetMap (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "bennett2010openstreetmap"

\end_inset

) and associated tools for data extraction and treatment.
\begin_inset VSpace bigskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Concerning temporal data of bike repartition, no time-series are publically
 available on the API of the company exploiting renting bikes in Paris,
 so we wrote a script which is constantly running on a web server, collecting
 all 5 minutes all data of all stations in Paris.
 Simple treatment will give us exploitable time-series for the calibration
 of the model.
 Statistical analysis of these data will be done in the frame of an other
 project and could be useful in our case for a better parametrization.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Expected results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We expect to obtain a running ABM, integrating real GIS data and that could
 be calibrated on the real time-series or on statistical extrapolation from
 these data.
 The model will include parameters translating possible local measures (that
 could be e.
 g.
 propensy of users to climb the hill, general radius of knowledge of user
 around fixed points, etc.
 ) on which we will be able to explore different scenarii corresponding
 to different real measures.
\begin_inset VSpace bigskip

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We expect also to proceed to sensitivity analysis (on parameters but also
 on spatial configurations) and exploration of some parts of the parameter
 space of the model before drawing conclusions from the investigations on
 possible measures.
