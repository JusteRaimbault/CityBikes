Context
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bike Sharing system have recently been the object of common but also scientific
 interest.
 The multiplication of implementation across many countries of the world,
 following the example of European Cities, has shown his potential as a
 new flexible and ecological transportation system (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "demaio2009bike"

\end_inset

).
 In 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "midgley2009role"

\end_inset

 this new transportation mode is presented as being totally complementary
 to the overall transportation part of an urban system.
\begin_inset VSpace bigskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It however raises particular issues in the conception and in the exploitation
 of the system, because of the spatial and temporal heterogeneity in use
 patterns.
 Therefore a consequent number of studies have been lead in operationnal
 research in order to optimise the initial design of the system (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "lin2011hub,lin2011strategic"

\end_inset

 for example) or the bike redistribution process which is essential for
 maintaining a good level of service (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "nair2011fleet,kek2006relocation"

\end_inset

).
\begin_inset VSpace bigskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The understanding of the mechanisms of such a system is essential for a
 good management of it.
 Therefore one can use statistical models, such as the work done on bike-sharing
 system of Lyon, for which statistical cyclic models were used (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "borgnat2009studying,borgnat2009modelisation"

\end_inset

), including elaborated statistical estimators (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "michau2011peut"

\end_inset

) and spatial analysis were done (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "borgnat2009spatial,jensen2010characterizing"

\end_inset

).
 An other approach is closer to datamining techniques, such as basic visualisati
on of many systems (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "o2013mining"

\end_inset

) or application of clustering datamining techniques (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "vogel2011understanding,kaltenbrunner2010urban"

\end_inset

).
 We will place ourselves between the two approaches in the following.

\begin_layout Subsection
Presentation of the project
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our aim is to apprehend both generally and specifically a large set of data
 representing exhaustively the working of a bike sharing system during a
 given time period, that is Paris' bike-sharing system during approximatively
 3 months.
 That system, the largest in the world, has been studied in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "nair2013large"

\end_inset

.
 We want to extend this analysis with other methods inspired from ones used
 on other systems.
 A part of our work will be aimed at providing a statistical parametrisation
 for an agent-based model that we won't detail here since that statistical
 approach will have in itself self-consistence.

\begin_layout Section
Data collection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Type of data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Data for the statistical analysis are public available data (open data)
 from the bike-sharing system of Paris (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

V'Lib
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

), provided by the operating company in direct time on a dedicated website
 (url 
\family typewriter
http://api.jcdecaux.com
\family default
, for which the format of request is precised on 
\family typewriter
developer.jcdecaux.com
\family default
).
 It provides only the status of docking stations at the request time so
 we had to automatize the data collection process on a large time period
 in order to have significant time-series.
 Process is detailed in the following.
\begin_inset VSpace bigskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We chose to proceed that way for the data collection first because the obtention
 of more precise data from the company can raise several problems such as
 confidentiality issues or more constraining for our research, lead to an
 lack of independance in the design of the modeling process, since most
 of the time delivering of data had its price that is at least answering
 to some question asked by the company.
 Secondly, we argue that our experience will be one way of testing the possibili
ties and limits of open data: if the public provided data can lead to relatively
 good results compared to what can be obtained with a larger set.
 However, if our research process becomes quicky limitated by the lack of
 precision or diversity in the data, that will bring one essential question
 on front, that is that open data does not necessarly means freedom not
 exhaustivity, and that the control of the provided data can implicitely
 be highly dangerous for the global opening process.
 On that point, we follow

 when he argues that a necessary condition of an open scientific cumulative
 process is a total transparency in the methods and an exhausting sharing
 of implementations of models of simulation and of data.
 Furthermore we wanted to avoid any risk of implicit reporting spin since
 it stays a major issue today for the quality of research as it is claimed

The purpose of data sharing by the company in our case was surely, because
 of the nature of the available data, i.
 e.
 only current time stations status, nothing more than current time information
 and mapping.
 However, we will see that we can use them for statistical analysis and
 obtain quite good results.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Data collection process
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A script requesting current data to the API and saving it into a file have
 been written and scheduled each 5 minutes on a remote server (we did not
 choose finer temporal granularity for a material reason, because the size
 of data becomes quickly huge and storage becomes then an issue).
 Data on remote server is then zipped everyday for storage purpose.
 When needed we download the files and process them with R using 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "couture2013rjson"

\end_inset

 in order to store them locally on a reduced form (csv) that can be called
 directly by our data processing algorithms.
 Note that it would have been more logical to process the data remotely
 and store them under the reduced form but technical reasons were an obstacle
 (in particular the installation of R on the remote machine).
 We also extracted from extensive files static information such as numerotation
 and coordinates of docking stations, what have been useful after for example
 to create a geographical file for map drawing with

 We collected data for all Paris during around 3 month, following statistical
 analysis are done on these data.

\begin_layout Standard
To have an idea of the cyclic character of daily mobility patterns, we can
 plot the total number of available bikes at docking stations against time.
 If we suppose the total number of bikes constant over the time duration
 of the plot, what seems reasonnable even on the all time period our data
 cover (even if there are surely variations because for example of bike
 reparations, they are surely neglectible regarding the total number of
 bikes, which is around 15000), this plot is exactly the complementary of
 the quantity of current travel as a function of time, what allows to visualize
 mobility tendancies.
 Fig.
 2 shows the obtained curve that fits the expected results, showing in particula
r the distinction between week days and weekends.

 in system use.
 One can expect for example to see distinction in time between residential
 and activity areas for the quantity of available bikes in stations.
 This allows to visualise global and local heterogeneity patterns.

Extraction of patterns
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A first step in the treatment of data is to extract typical patterns in
 use of the system.
 In 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "vogel2011understanding"

\end_inset

, datamining techniques, and especially clustering of activity profiles,
 are used to extract typical patterns in station use.
 We propose to use similar methodology in order to identify typical overall
 day profiles and classify them.
 We expect to be able to differentiate weekdays from week-ends for example,
 but also see the influence of climate on use patterns.
 The clustering of time-series offer an alternative for a predictive model,
 as the cyclic model proposed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "borgnat2009modelisation,borgnat2009studying"

\end_inset

.
\begin_inset VSpace bigskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A day is exhaustively represented by the time-series, defined on all the
 stations of the system 
\begin_inset Formula $s\in S$
\end_inset

, and on a discrete time sample 
\begin_inset Formula $T=\{0,\tau,...,N\tau\}$
\end_inset

 (with 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 time step of the data, 5min in our case), 
\begin_inset Formula $(b(s,t))_{s\in S,t\in T}$
\end_inset

 of availables bikes at each stations.
 Each station has a maximal capacity 
\begin_inset Formula $c(s)$
\end_inset

 that allow to define the number of free parking places 
\begin_inset Formula $p(s)=c(s)-b(s)$
\end_inset

 and the load factor wich can be more convenient to work with since it is
 normalised 
\begin_inset Formula $lf(s)=\frac{b(s)}{c(s)}$
\end_inset

.
 The overall clustering process first aims to reduce the dimension of the
 representation of a day without loosing majority of information, and then
 to be able then to classify days and make predictions on the day characteristic
s from its data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace bigskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First the dimension is reduced through a sampling process that can be seen
 as a projection from the space of complete time-series to a space of smaller
 dimension.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi\in\mathbb{N}^{\mathbb{N}}$
\end_inset

 is a extraction then the sampling is defined as the canonic projection
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{S}:\mathbb{R}^{\left|T\right|\left|S\right|}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{\left|\varphi(T)\right|\left|S\right|}$
\end_inset

.
 The question of the value of the time step for sampling is important.
 We tried for many values and looked at the possible loss of information
 through the evolution of clustering coefficient regarding number of clusters.
 It appeared that we had still good precision for large time steps such
 as one hour.
 See fig.
 4 for more precision on the influence of sampling step.

We proceed then for each day to a k-means algorithm on the sampled time-series
 (as described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "warren2005clustering"

\end_inset

), in order to reduce more the dimension needed to represent a day.
 Intuitively, that corresponds to a classification of stations according
 to their 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

profile
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 We take in practice 20 clusters, what allows to divide by 100 the dimension.
 The final step is to cluster the representations of the days for establishing
 a classification of days.
 With two clusters, one expect to isolate weekdays from weekends, although
 kmeans can lead to bad results if cardinal of clusters appear to be imbalanced.
 In our case it worked quite well and we were able to reproduce that distinction.
 However, a finer distinction (e.
 g.
 between rainy and shiny days) was not possible and some work on a more
 specialized clustering algorithm (kmeans is very general) would be needed
 to obtain more precise results.
 Fig.
 5 shows the comparison between real curves of available bikes and predicted
 curves by the clustering algorithm.

Inference of origin/destination fields
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An other crucial point of the analysis is the estimation of real origin
 and destinations of users of the system.
 If the original purpose is in our case to obtain a parametrisation for
 an agent-based model as we already explained, this problem has its own
 internal value.
 Indeed a lot of research in economic geography and transportation geography
 aims at evaluating real Origin/Destination fields in order to integrate
 them into transportation/landuse models (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "leurent2006modelisation"

\end_inset

 for example).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace bigskip

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our statistical model for the inference of field is a non-parametric estimation
 with Gaussian kernels (described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "tsybakov2004introduction"

\end_inset

).
 Considering the real departures and arrivals in bike stations (that are
 easily calculated by discrete differentiation of data), we count each as
 a contribution to the global field at the current time step, smoothed with
 Gaussian kernel (that appeared to be enough in practice).
 At time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 ,with a parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 fixing kernel sizes (each kernel has the same size, further work could
 be done to test the influence of multiple sizes, weighted by the maximum
 of the kernel distribution for example) and a set of effective arrivals
 
\begin_inset Formula $(d_{i}(t))$
\end_inset

 at the corresponding coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $(\vec{x}_{i}(t))$
\end_inset

, the spatial field of destinations is estimated as, with 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 normalisation factor,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
[D(t)](\vec{x})=\frac{1}{K}\sum_{i}d_{i}(t)\cdot exp(\frac{\left\Vert \vec{x}-\vec{x}_{i}\right\Vert }{2\sigma^{2}})
\]

\end_inset

We do the same for the origin field.
 Kernel estimations are done with the ergonomic package 
\family typewriter
kernlab
\family default
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

).
 These extrapolated fields are then discretised and used as parametrisation
 for the agent-based models.
 We also use them to extrapolate bicycle flows on a day.

Mapping of bicycle flows
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One interesting application of the preceeding point is the extrapolation
 and mapping of flows on a day.
 Especially, it allows to see if data we have are enough to understand the
 mechanisms of the system, i.
 e.
 infer reasonnably well possible travels, or if more would be needed.

Given mean time-series on a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

standard day
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (extracted through clustering and mean of the larger cluster), we extract
 on all the city the time-serie of effective departures and we calculate
 the origin field.
 Then for each step of time, we draw randomly the expected number of trips
 by the following process for each trip:

Origin

 is drawn from the origin probability field

 is drawn following a Gaussian law of mean 2km and standard deviation 800m
 according to the distribution of travel distances proposed in

) in the frame of the agent-based modeling.
 Fig.
 7 shows the obtained map.
 We observe expected patterns in the center but irregularities for some
 links, especially in south-east.
 However, we claim having a good interpolation of the internal mechanisms
 of the system from only partial data, answering partially to the question
 raised in 2.

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We were able to proceed to statistical analysis of large data for a better
 understanding of the working of a bike-sharing system.
 Although reults were sometimes quite limited, we showed that it was possible
 to create knowledge from Open Data that were not aimed at that, what is
 quite significant from an epistemological point of view.
 We argue that it is a proof of the need of such data opening process, in
 all fields, but also in a more extended way.

\begin_layout Standard
Further development of that project could be a stronger assessment and explorati
on of used methods, and also the insertion of methods from other fields
 such as statistical medicine: considering redistribution events as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

treatment
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 on stations, and evaluating adverse events as load-factor over a threshold
 for example, it would be able to consider a district as a trial (treatment
 group: ay with redistribution, control group without) and proceed to a
 meta-analysis on all district, in order to quantify the effect of redistributio
n on the system.
 Such transposition may however remain discutable and need to be considered
 deeper.
